Write a program to find anagrams in a given list of words. Two words are called anagrams if one word can be formed by rearranging letters of another. For example ‘eat’, ‘ate’ and ‘tea’ are anagrams.
>>> anagrams(['eat', 'ate', 'done', 'tea', 'soup', 'node']) 
[['eat', 'ate', 'tea], ['done', 'node'], ['soup']]
